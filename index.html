                Everyone needs something that brings them joy outside of school, work, or daily routines. For me, hobbies are more than just pastimes—
                they are ways to express myself, explore new experiences, and stay motivated. Below are some of the hobbies I enjoy and others I’m eager to dive into one day.

                    Gaming has been one of my core hobbies since I was a child. I still remember getting my first console and spending hours trying to beat each level in Mario.
                    What started as a fun way to pass time has now grown into a passion that influences how I think, solve problems, and even how I relate to people.

                <p>
                    While many people enjoy gaming for entertainment, I believe it offers much more:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sense of Achievement:</strong> Whether it’s leveling up, solving a puzzle, or completing a hard challenge, games offer a rewarding sense of progress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Escapism and Relaxation:</strong> Gaming provides a break from the real world, allowing me to relax and immerse myself in creative worlds and stories.</li>
                    <li><strong>Connection with Others:</strong> Through co-op and multiplayer games, I’ve made friends and shared laughs—even with people across the globe.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I especially love story-driven games like *The Last of Us* or *Red Dead Redemption 2*, where the characters and decisions feel impactful. They’re like interactive movies, making every moment feel personal and memorable.

                    My older cousin was a huge influence. He introduced me and my little brother to retro games like *Contra* and *Castlevania*, my brother and I would spend entire weekends trying to beat them together.
                    These early memories are why I associate gaming not just with fun, but with family and bonding.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, I follow gaming content creators, developers, and YouTube reviewers. Seeing how passionate others are has made me think about maybe building my own game someday.

                <h2>Hobbies I Want to Try</h2>
                <p>
                    While gaming is currently my main hobby, there are several others I’d love to explore in the future:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hiking & Camping:</strong> I want to connect more with nature and challenge myself physically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Art:</strong> I’ve always admired character design and would love to learn how to draw game characters and environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Music Production:</strong> Creating music for fun or even for games is something that really excites me.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Each of these hobbies would allow me to grow in different ways—creatively, physically, and mentally.

            <h3>Gaming Quote</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “Games have so much freedom. You can go anywhere you want.” — Jeneva Chen
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                I love this quote because it captures the magic of gaming: the freedom to explore, make choices, and live stories beyond reality.
