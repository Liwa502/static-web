                Everyone needs something that brings them joy outside of school, work, or daily routines. For me, hobbies are more than just pastimes—
                they are ways to express myself, explore new experiences, and stay motivated. Below are some of the hobbies I enjoy and others I’m eager to dive into one day.

            <p>
                Gaming has been one of my core hobbies since I was a child. What started as a fun pastime has grown into a passion that influences how I think and relate to people.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sense of Achievement:</strong> Progress through levels and challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Escapism and Relaxation:</strong> Immerse in creative worlds and stories.</li>
                <li><strong>Connection with Others:</strong> Share experiences with friends and global players.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Story-driven games like <em>The Last of Us</em> or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> make every moment feel personal and memorable.

            <h2>Who Inspired My Gaming Hobby?</h2>
            <figure>

            <p>
                My older cousin introduced me to retro games like <em>Contra</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>. These memories make gaming not just fun, but about family bonding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I follow content creators and developers, inspiring me to maybe build my own game someday.
